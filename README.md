# Northcoders News API
We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Instructions for cloning this repo:

If anyone clone this repo , they will need to create two .env files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). 
Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
